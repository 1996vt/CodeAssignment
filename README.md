Hi, 
This is the solution to the problem in which we need to validate a cricket team based on player selected.

I have followed pom structure and have used below stack -
-**Java**
-**Test-NG**
-**JSON-Simple**
-**Log4j2**

**Overview**-
The project contains 3 major packages - main/java/helper, resource/TestData/ and test/java

test/java - contains test class
resource/TestData/ - contains json data under test
main/java/helper - contains a method to grab that data

**STEPS TO RUN**-
Just with pom clean install we can get all the major dependencies required for this to execute.
It can be executed directly by running test in -'RcbTeamTest.java' Class **OR**
we can run it by testng.xml to get a small report in test-output folder
